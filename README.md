## Hang-Cat aka Hang-Man

Simple react app created in my spare time during the frontend block of Northcoders.

To run the app please follow these instructions:

1. Clone the current repo - git clone https://github.com/tarikmedjber/hangman-fungame-tarikmedjber/
2. cd into the cloned repo and open it on vsCode. - cd hangman-fungame-tarikmedjber
3. npm install
4. npm start

Please then based off screen size, use zoom so the alphabet and hangcat title is in frame.

This is a fun react app I created, no cats were harmed in the making of this.
